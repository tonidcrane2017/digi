### Example Script for Self-Recorded Meditation

#### 5-Minute Calm Meditation
```
"Welcome. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes if that feels safe.
Take a deep breath in... and out.

For the next few minutes, simply focus on your breathing.
Notice the air coming in... and going out.

If your mind wanders, that's okay. Gently bring your attention back to your breath.

You are safe. You are okay. Just breathe.
[Continue with gentle breathing cues for 5 minutes]"
```
